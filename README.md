Amazon Clone
The Amazon Clone project is a static front-end web application developed using  HTML and CSS. The primary objective of this project is to replicate the design and layout of Amazon’s homepage, providing a learning opportunity for web development enthusiasts to improve their skills in structuring content and applying modern CSS techniques.
Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a functional clone of the Amazon website's user interface without relying on JavaScript or backend technologies. It is designed for practice and education, helping developers understand how to recreate complex, real-world website designs with clean, responsive, and maintainable code.
Features
This clone includes several key features:
Header Section: A top navigation bar similar to Amazon’s, with a search bar, logo, and multiple navigation links.
Product Listings: A grid layout for displaying products, mimicking Amazon’s product cards. Each product card includes a product image, title, price, and other relevant information.
Footer Section: A structured footer with links to various informational pages, terms of service, and company information.
Responsive Design: The project is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience across devices like desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Technology Stack
This project is built entirely using HTML5 and CSS3. It focuses on using semantic HTML elements to create structured content, while CSS is used for layout, styling, and making the site responsive through the use of media queries.
Educational Value
By working on this project, developers can gain hands-on experience in building a real-world layout from scratch, understanding CSS positioning, flexbox, and responsive web design, all while improving code organization and best practices.
